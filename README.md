 <p>The course covers the basics of mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (ORM) with a focus on the Django framework. It begins with an introduction to ORM and its key concepts before moving on to working with models in Django, including defining models, fields, and methods. The course then delves into advanced topics such as migrations and the Django admin interface, query operations, model relationships, and inheritance. Students will also learn more complex techniques for working with models and handling ORM queries in Django. Additionally, the course covers another popular Python ORM framework - SQLAlchemy, which offers an alternative approach. During the training, exercises will be provided to help participants solidify their knowledge at each step. By the end of this course, participants will acquire basic skills for building robust, scalable, and efficient web applications powered by databases using Python ORM frameworks.</p>
